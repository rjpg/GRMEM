           As I've already said it in the documentation, I've coded this
       program like a snowball falling, getting bigger and bigger. Three
       years  ago, I started to write a program which only worked on the
       internal  pc speaker, then I added more and more features. Here's
       the  list of improvements which were  made since version 1.3, the
       first one to have a documentation.
